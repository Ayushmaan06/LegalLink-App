The petitioner, a non-profit organization working for the upliftment of underprivileged communities, filed a Public Interest Litigation (PIL) under Article 32 of the Constitution of India challenging the arbitrary eviction of slum dwellers in the city of Mumbai without any alternative rehabilitation measures. The petitioner contended that the actions of the municipal authorities violated the right to life and livelihood guaranteed under Article 21 of the Constitution. The petition further alleged that the eviction drive was carried out in blatant disregard of the principles laid down in previous judgments of the Supreme Court, including the landmark Olga Tellis case, which recognized the right to livelihood as an integral part of the right to life. The respondents, including the municipal corporation and the state government, justified their actions on the grounds of city beautification, removal of encroachments, and development of public infrastructure. They submitted that due process had been followed and that alternative sites were being considered for relocation. The Court, after hearing both parties, appointed an amicus curiae to investigate the ground reality and submit a report.
